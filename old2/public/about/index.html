<h5 id="senior-software-engineer-at-springrole">Senior Software Engineer at SpringRole</h5>

<p>As a senior engineer, I was responsible for the entire data infra for the client Plowz &amp; Mowz. When I started the position, there was no data infrastructure for the client; everything was in excel sheet.</p>

<p>I laid down the entire infrastructure, by setting up data warehouse in Redshift, daily, hourly imports from back-end database, events from web and mobile apps etc</p>

<p>In this role, my biggest accomplishment is building a Media Source Performance module. This helped us to track the performance of various media sources by making use of Appsflyer. This is a very critical module as we spent close to a million dollar in advertisement in 2019.</p>

<p>The other biggest accomplishment is Job Cost module, which properly track the revenue of the company. Even though it is a simple ETL process, it highly benefited the company in the long run to properly track the money coming in and going out.</p>

<h5 id="senior-software-engineer-at-science-inc">Senior Software Engineer at Science Inc</h5>

<p>This role paved my way into the field of data science. I was the first engineer hired in the data team for the product - Wishbone, Yarn etc. The apps were the top 10 iTunes apps in 2015. Most of the initial work was setting up data imports and streaming data. Since there are tons of data, ETL was the hardest part.</p>

<p>My biggest challenge was how to manage a warehouse with data growing at an exponential rate. This was the hardest part and we did it using a lot of compression techniques and moving least used data to Redshift spectrum etc.</p>

<p>My biggest learning is how to mentally grow and cope with a high growth startup, with users reaching upto 10 million and wishbone cards hitting close to a billion.</p>

<p>Before getting into data, I was involved in the backend infrastructure of the mobile ad company called ChirpAds and Playhaven. Playhaven is a popular ad game platform spinned out of UpSight.</p>

<p>The biggest challenge was the merging of two ad networks into one. During this process, we need to migrate data and make sure ads are running across both platforms.</p>
